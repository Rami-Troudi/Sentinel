        "\n",
        "### Business Context\n",
        "\n",
        "Insurance companies, particularly **Lloyd Assurance**, face significant challenges in road safety and risk management:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reactive Risk Assessment**: Insurance companies evaluate driver risk primarily after accidents occur, leading to inaccurate premium pricing and increased claims costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limited Behavioral Data**: Traditional insurance models rely on static factors (age, vehicle type, location) rather than actual driving behavior, resulting in poor risk segmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Accident Rates**: Tunisia experiences high road accident rates with limited preventive measures. Insurance companies lack tools to incentivize and reward safe driving behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lack of Engagement**: Customers have no visibility into their driving performance and no motivation to improve, leading to continued risky behavior and higher claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Geographic Risk Gaps**: Insurance companies cannot identify high-risk road zones dynamically, missing opportunities for targeted interventions and pricing adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "**How can we leverage IoT sensor data and artificial intelligence to proactively assess driver behavior, predict risk levels, identify dangerous zones, and incentivize safer driving through personalized feedback and rewards?**\n",

        "\n",
        "- **For Drivers**: Improved safety awareness, reduced accident risk, financial rewards for good behavior\n",
        "- **For Lloyd Assurance**: Reduced claims, better risk pricing, enhanced customer loyalty, competitive differentiation\n",
